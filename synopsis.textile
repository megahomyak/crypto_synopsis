h1. Basic terminology

- Hash := A fixed-width product of a one-way function.
- Nonce := A number that is added to the block to make its hash acquire some specific properties, which define the block as valid.
- Block := A data structure containing its number, some arbitrary data, a hash of its parent and nonce.
- Blockchain := A sequence of blocks, chained using their parents' hashes.
- Transaction := A piece of data, incorporated in sequences into a block, that states what amount of currency have been transferred from who to who.

h1. Digital signatures

- A key pair := Two pieces of information that, when passed into a cryptographic function, can respectively decrypt and encrypt the same data. Basically, they reverse the product of each other.
- Public key := A key that is accessible by anyone.
- Private key := A key that is stored privately.
- Digital signature := A hash of the document embedded with the document itself, encrypted with one of the keys.

Signed transaction contains the information about:
* The amount of currency
* To whom it's been sent
* The public key of the user
* The signature: all the information above, hashed and signed with a private key
