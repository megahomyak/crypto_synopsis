Very good web3 info source, in Russian: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmizxCJ2qgvvm8AvFzzdt5g

h1. Basic terminology

- Hash := A fixed-width product of a one-way function.
- Nonce := A number that is added to the block to make its hash acquire some specific properties, which define the block as valid.
- Block := A data structure containing its number, some arbitrary data, a hash of its parent and nonce.
- Blockchain := A sequence of blocks, chained using their parents' hashes.
- Transaction := A piece of data, incorporated in sequences into a block, that states what amount of currency have been transferred from who to who.

h1. Digital signatures

- A key pair := Two pieces of information that, when passed into a cryptographic function, can respectively decrypt and encrypt the same data. Basically, they reverse the product of each other.
- Public key := A key that is accessible by anyone.
- Private key := A key that is stored privately.
- Digital signature := A hash of the document embedded with the document itself, encrypted with one of the keys.

Signed transaction contains the information about:
* The amount of currency
* To whom it's been sent
* The public key of the user
* The signature: all the information above, hashed and signed with a private key

h1. Some ways to acquire consensus

h2. Proof of work

The miner should add a nonce to the block, so that the block's hash has some special properties (for example, a lot of zeros at the beginning).
The longest chain of blocks is trusted, so sometimes there will be a tie.

h2. Proof of stake

People vote with their cryptocurrencies for the block producers, getting a fee from each new block in return.
Some block producers are elected, but only one of them produces blocks at a single moment of time, others just sign the produced blocks. Not all the others should sign the block for it to be valid, only a part of the group is needed.
If a block producer misbehaves, he is punished by the rules of the blockchain where it took place.
The aspects of this one highly depend on the chosen blockchain network.
